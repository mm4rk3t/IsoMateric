# IsoMateric

When looking at the code take in consideration that this is my first project and I am a noob when it comes to programming.

It only builds on linux at the moment, and relative paths don't work, as you can see when trying to load shader files.

### TO-DO:
- [ ] Figure out why nothing renders below a certain point in the window
